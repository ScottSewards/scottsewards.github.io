          <h3>PomPay</h3>
          <q>Where Patreon meets cryptocurrency.</q>

          <h3>HotPot</h3>
          <q>A community-based forum.</q>
          <p>HotPot is a developing community-based public forum where community moderators are elected by users. It is a blend of Reddit and vBulletin.</p>
          <p>The website uses custom frameworks for front-end and back-end. In fact, Super Simple was made because HotPot needed a clean, modern look for a text heavy website.</p>

          <p>Super Simple is a developing accessible, responsive layout and content framework where styles are applied to elements and classes are few.</p>
          <p>The framework implements the latest HTML, CSS and JavaScript features so old browsers are not supported.</p>
